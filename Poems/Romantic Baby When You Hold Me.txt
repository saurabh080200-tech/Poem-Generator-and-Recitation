Baby, when you hold me, my emotions makes it clear
Just how much you mean to me while we are laying here.
I listen to your heartbeat in rhythm with my own,
With every pound that warming sound keeps me safe with love you've shown.

Baby, when you touch me with hands so soft but strong,
You wrap me in your warm embrace, just where I belong.
You hold me close and comfort me all throughout the night
Until you open up your eyes to first signs of daylight.

Baby when you kiss me before you start your day,
The happiness you bring my heart, no words can ever say.
You make my life so beautiful, wonderful, and new.
You're my hopes and dreams. You're my everything; I'm so in love with you.
