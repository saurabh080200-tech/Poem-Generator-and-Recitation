One rainy day on my way home from school,
I found a big worm and thought it was cool.

I picked up the worm with my bare hand,
held it up high, thinking how grand!

The worm was so cute and wiggled a lot.
I put him in my pocket to show Mom what I'd caught.

What will she say when I show her my find?
Will she let me keep it? I hope she won't mind.

Mom was in the kitchen when I showed her what I'd found.
She screamed, "No, way! Put it back in the ground!"

Now I'm so angry; she always says, "No."
If she won't let me keep it, then I will just go!

So me and my worm packed a sandwich or two,
ran out the door, and down the street we both flew.

We walked to the park and sat on a bench.
I pulled out my worm and noticed a stench.

He looked kind of floppy but wiggled a bit.
I thought, "Oh my Gosh, my worm is not fit!"

I laid him in the dirt and let him go free.
I guess that my pocket was not the best place to be.
